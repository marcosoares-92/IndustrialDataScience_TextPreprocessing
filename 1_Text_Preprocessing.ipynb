    "There are two types of matching methods: greedy and non-greedy (also called lazy) operators. \n",
    "\n",
    "Greedy operators\n",
    "- The standard quantifiers are greedy by default, meaning that they will attempt to match as many characters as possible.\n",
    "    - Standard quantifiers: * , + , ? , {num, num}\n",
    "    - Example: re.match(r\"\\d+\", \"12345bcada\") - returns: <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 5), match='12345'>\n",
    "    - We can explain this in the following way: our quantifier will start by matching the first digit found, '1'. \n",
    "    - Because it is greedy, it will keep going to find 'more' digits and stop only when no other digit can be matched, returning '12345'.\n",
    "- If the greedy quantifier has matched so many characters that can not match the rest of pattern, it will backtrack, giving up characters matched earlier one at a time and try again. \n",
    "- Backtracking is like driving a car without a map. If you drive through a path and hit a dead end street, you need to backtrack along your road to an earlier point to take another street. \n",
    "    - Example: re.match(r\".*hello\", \"xhelloxxxxxx\") - returns: <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 6), match='xhello'>\n",
    "    - We use the greedy quantifier .* to find anything, zero or more times, followed by the letters \"h\" \"e\" \"l\" \"l\" \"o\". \n",
    "    - We can see here that it returns the pattern 'xhello'. \n",
    "    - So our greedy quantifier will start by matching as much as possible, the entire string. \n",
    "    - Then, it tries to match the h, but there are no characters left. So it backtracks, giving up one matched character. \n",
    "    - Trying again, it still doesn't match the h, so it backtracks one more step repeatedly until it finally matches the h in the regex, and the rest of the characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-greedy (lazy) operators\n",
    "- Because they have lazy behavior, non-greedy quantifiers will attempt to match as few characters as needed, returning the shortest match. \n",
    "- To obtain non-greedy quantifiers, we can append a question mark at the end of the greedy quantifiers to convert them into lazy. \n",
    "    - Example: re.match(r\"\\d+?\", \"12345bcada\") - returns: <_sre.SRE_Match object; span=(0, 1), match='1'>\n",
    "    - Now, our non-greedy quantifier will return the pattern '1'. \n",
    "    - In this case, our quantifier will start by matching the first digit found, '1'. \n",
    "    - Because it is non-greedy, it will stop there, as we stated that we want 'one or more', and 1 is as few as needed.\n",
    "- Non-greedy quantifiers also backtrack. \n",
    "- In this case, if they have matched so few characters that the rest of the pattern cannot match, they backtrack, expand the matched character one at a time, and try again. \n",
    "- In the example above: this time we use the lazy quantifier .*?. Interestingly, we obtain the same match 'xhello'. \n",
    "- But, how this match was obtained is different from the first time: the lazy quantifier first matches as little as possible, nothing, leaving the entire string unmatched. \n",
    "- Then it tries to match the 'h', but it doesn't work. \n",
    "- So, it backtracks, matching one more character, the 'x'. Then, it tries again, this time matching the 'h', and afterwards, the rest of the regex.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even though greedy quantifiers lead to longer matches, they are sometimes the best option. \n",
    "- Because lazy quantifiers match as few as possible, they return a shorter match than we expected.\n",
    "    - Example: if you want to extract a word starting with 'a' and ending with 'e' in the string 'I like apple pie', you may think that applying the greedy regex r\"a.+e\" will return 'apple'. \n",
    "    - However, your match will be 'apple pie'. A way to overcome this is to make it lazy by using '?'' which will return 'apple'.\n",
    "- On the other hand, using greedy quantifiers always leads to longer matches that sometimes are not desired. \n",
    "    - Making quantifiers lazy by adding '?' to match a shorter pattern is a very important consideration to keep in mind when handling data for text mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of regex:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You want to extract the number contained in the sentence 'I was born on April 24th'. \n",
    "    - A lazy quantifier will make the regex return 2 and 4, because they will match as few characters as needed. \n",
    "    - However, a greedy quantifier will return the entire 24 due to its need to match as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.1. Use a lazy quantifier to match all numbers that appear in the variable sentiment_analysis:\n",
    "    numbers_found_lazy = re.findall(r\"[0-9]+?\", sentiment_analysis)\n",
